      ECO5064S: Behavioural Economics
      
      Behavioural economics is a relatively new field within economics. At its core is a strong interdisciplinary approach to modelling economic decision making. The course extends the framework of choice theory by incorporating two robust empirical findings about economic behaviour: (i) that people are boundedly rational; and (ii) that people frequently behave in other-regarding ways. The topics to be covered are: risk attitudes with bounded rationality (topic 1); risk preferences under exposure to stress and violence (topic 2);  rational altruism and and altruist punishment (topic 3); trust and social cohesion (topic 4); and emotions and decision making (topic 5).
      
      ECO5076S: Development Microeconomics
      This course is about the application of microeconomic analysis to issues of development in low and middle income countries. The main objective is to undertake a critical reading of recent research on the empirical microeconomics of development. Topics covered are: (1) the econometrics of impact evaluation; (2) land contracts and land reform; (3) intra-household resource allocation and gender bias; (4) the evaluation of human capital programs; (5) the structure of labour and credit markets in developing countries; and (6) the microeconomic impacts of international trade.
